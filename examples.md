title: Futhark by Example
---

The following is a hands-on introduction to Futhark through a
collection of commented programs, listed in roughly increasing order
of complexity.  You can load the programs into [the
interpreter](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/man/futhark-repl.html)
to experiment with them. For a conventional introduction to the
language, [Parallel Programming in
Futhark](https://futhark-book.readthedocs.io) may be a better choice.
For more examples, you can check our implemented
[benchmarks](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks). We also
maintain a list of [projects using Futhark](#projects-using-futhark).

Some of the example programs use
[directives](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-literate.html)
for plotting or rendering graphics.

# Examples from Dex

The following examples are ported from
[Dex](https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang), a dependently typed
functional array language that uses a somewhat different approach to
describing loop processing. We\'ve tried to keep the original naming
scheme and programming style.

-   [Mandelbrot set](examples/dex-mandelbrot.html)
-   [Multi-step ray tracer](examples/dex-raytrace.html)

# External examples

- [OCaml-GPU wordcount
  example](https://github.com/ArulselvanMadhavan/ocaml_gpu_wordcount)
  by calling Futhark.

# Projects using Futhark

The majority of written Futhark code is probably still Futhark's own
test and benchmark suites. However, there are some programs that have
been written in Futhark because it was a good tool for the job, and not
just to test the compiler. A possibly incomplete list:

[Diving Beet](https://github.com/Athas/diving-beet) is a *falling sand*
game, which is a kind of simple particle simulator toy. Its main purpose
is to produce pretty effects. There is a [blog
post](/blog/2016-12-04-diving-beet.html) with details and a video.

[Futball](https://github.com/Athas/futball) is a game about avoiding
getting hit by balls. The rendering engine is a ray tracer written in
Futhark.

[Futcam](https://github.com/nqpz/futcam) is an application that applies
stacks of interactively configurable filters to a webcam stream. Futhark
is used to implement the filters.

[Futracer](https://github.com/nqpz/futracer) is a fairly slow
brute-force ray tracer written in Futhark.

[Futswirl](https://github.com/nqpz/futswirl) is a fractal generator
based on [iterated function
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system).

[Neptune](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune) is an
implementation of the [Poseidon hash
function](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/) tuned for
[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), where [the GPU
parts](https://github.com/filecoin-project/neptune-triton) have been
implemented in Futhark.

[Palathark](https://githepia.hesge.ch/orestis.malaspin/palathark) is a
Futhark implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method.

[Ray Tracing in One Weekend in
Futhark](https://github.com/athas/raytracinginoneweekendinfuthark) and
[Ray Tracing: the Next Week in
Futhark](https://github.com/athas/raytracingthenextweekinfuthark/) are
implementations based on Peter Shirley\'s book series. These are by no
means real-time ray tracers, but support advanced effects and make use
of acceleration structures like BVH trees.

[Pareas](https://github.com/Snektron/pareas) is a compiler implemented
in Futhark and C++.
