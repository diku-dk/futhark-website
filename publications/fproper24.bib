abstract = {This paper compares OpenCL, CUDA, and HIP as compilation targets for
Futhark, a functional array language. We compare the performance of
OpenCL versus CUDA, and OpenCL versus HIP, on the code generated by
the Futhark compiler on a collection of 48 application benchmarks on
two different GPUs. Despite the generated code in most cases being
equivalent, we observe significant performance differences on the
same hardware, ranging from 0.42x to 1.72x in the most extreme
cases. We identify the root causes of most of these differences,
many of which are due to relatively superficial details such as
inconsistent defaults regarding compiler optimisation and numerical
accuracy, although a few remain mysterious.},
