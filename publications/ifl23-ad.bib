abstract = {We present and evaluate the Futhark implementation of reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) for the basic blocks of parallel programming: reduce, prefix sum (scan), and reduce-by-index (multi-reduce). We present derivations of general-case algorithms, and then discuss several specializations that result in efficient differentiation of most cases of practical interest. We report an experiment that evaluates the GPU performance of the differentiated code and highlights the impact of the proposed specializations as well as the strengths and weaknesses of differentiating at high level bulk-parallel operators vs “differentiating the memory”, i.e., low-level implementations that access/update individual array elements.},
