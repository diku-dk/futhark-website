The Futhark documentation is divided into several parts. The in-progress
book [Parallel Programming in
Futhark](https://futhark-book.readthedocs.io) can be read freely online,
and is the starting point for learning Futhark. The [Futhark User\'s
Guide](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable) contains detailed
instructions on how to use the compilers, as well as the [language
reference](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/language-reference.html)
and instructions on [how to install the Futhark
compiler](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).

There is also automatically generated [documentation for the Futhark
prelude](https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/). The prelude library is
very small, so in most cases you will want to use [external
packages](https://futhark-lang.org/pkgs/).

If there is something you believe should be documented, but is not, you
are very welcome to report the omission as a bug on our bug tracker. See
the page [Get Involved](/getinvolved.html) for more information.

# Bridges

The Futhark compiler can generate C or Python code. A bridge allows
programs written in other languages to conveniently call this code.

-   **Haskell**: [Futhask](https://gitlab.com/Gusten_Isfeldt/futhask)
-   **Python**:
    [futhark-pycffi](https://github.com/pepijndevos/futhark-pycffi/) (or
    the compiler\'s [builtin Python
    backend](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/man/futhark-pyopencl.html),
    which is slower but more convenient)
-   **Rust**: [genfut](https://github.com/Erk-/genfut), [futhark-bindgen](https://github.com/zshipko/futhark-bindgen), [cargo-futhark](https://github.com/luleyleo/cargo-futhark)
-   **Standard ML**: [futhark-server-sml](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-server-sml)
-   **OCaml**: [futhark-bindgen](https://github.com/zshipko/futhark-bindgen)
